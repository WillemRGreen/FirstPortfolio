        <p>My name is Willem Green. I am a former Coffee Quality Professional living in Minneapolis, MN, and I am currently learning to code through Thinkful. </p>
        <p> So far, the things I am enjoying most about coding are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Creative and challenging problem solving</li>
          <li> Learning a new skill (always something I love)</li>
          <li> Being in a new community of passionate people!</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Welcome to my website!</p>

        <h3 class = "center-text"> About Me </h3>
        <p>I moved out to Minneapolis from Lewes, DE six years ago and have been working in the coffee scene since then. I started working as a barista trainer a few years later and became the beverage director for a series of cafes.
        </p>
        <p>
          After making the decision to leave the service industry, I had a discussion with a web dev and started looking into coding as a future career. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I'm happy to be learning with Thinkful and I'm looking forward to learning a whole lot more!
        </p>
